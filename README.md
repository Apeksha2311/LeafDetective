# LeafDetective

This project is focused on predicting plant diseases based on leaf images. The technology used to implement this project is the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification and Django for the web application.
ResNet-50 is a pre-trained CNN that has been trained on a large dataset of images. It is capable of recognizing a wide variety of features and patterns in images and can be fine-tuned for specific image classification tasks like plant disease detection.
Django is a popular web framework that is written in Python. It provides a simple and efficient way to build web applications quickly. It includes features like URL routing, database integration, and security features.
